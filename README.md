# Exo-Code

This repository was made for the Iowa State Robotics club for all of code used to control our motors.

RMD-X Motor Motion Protocol has all of the commands for the Motor, which have been provided by the manufacturer. 

This code is god awful, But it does work.

if you are stuck with a MyActuator motor this would be a decent code to debug with, but it is not practical for the original application.
